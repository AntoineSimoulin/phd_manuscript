\cleanchapterquote{Language is the most interesting manifestation of intelligence. Visual comprehension is something that many animals also have. In some cases, it is even better than that of humans. Chimpanzees also understand feelings and social contexts. But no other living being has such a complex language as we do. And language links all other manifestations of intelligence, because I can talk about what I see, feel and think and how I act.}{Richard Socher}{Head of research department at Salesforce}
